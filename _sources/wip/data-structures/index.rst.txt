Data structures for symbolic expressions
========================================

This will be the first of many blog posts discussing data structures and basic
algorithms for working with symbolic expressions. The reason for this is that I
want to change the way that SymPy's data structures work and I need to make
sure that lots of other people understand the design decisions that I am
considering.
